She was a little tense

The notice made no sense

I saw a little hermit crab

His coloring was oh so drab

It’s hard to see the butterfly

Because he flies across the sky

Hear the honking of the goose

I think he’s angry at the moose

His red sports car is just a dream

It needs no gas, it runs on steam

The children like the ocean shore

We want to leave but they want more

I made the cookies one by one

I hear the bell, so they are done

My cat, she likes to chase a mouse,

Especially one that’s in the house

Lightening, thunder, all around

Soon the rain falls on the ground

I tire of writing poems and rhyme

I think I need vacation time

Be not the first by whom the new are tried,

Nor yet the last to lay the old aside.

’Tis education forms the common mind,

Just as the twig is bent, the tree’s inclined.

O could I flow like thee, and make thy stream 

My great example, as it is my theme!

Singing he was, or fluting all the day;

He was as fresh as is the month of May

I have the measles and the mumps,

a gash, a rash and purple bumps

You say today is...Saturday?

G'bye, I'm going out to play!

I think that I shall never see

A poem lovely as a tree
